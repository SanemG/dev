# Dev

A new Flutter project for the **GitHub Actions x DEV Hackathon!**.

This GitHub Action "**Flutter Web CI**" is designed to automate the developers work to: 
* Configure the flutter tool for web support
* Build an app with web support
* Archive the build and upload the Artifact
* Download the Artifact
* Display structure of build files
* Use GitHub Pages to host your Flutter Web app
